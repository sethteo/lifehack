Introduction: 

NFTicket uses NFTs to combat ticketing scams and scalping. NFTs provide security and traceability, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud. Tickets are sold directly by organizers or on a marketplace. Smart contracts ensure secure transactions, and organizers earn from secondary sales. Scalping is reduced by limiting NFTs per wallet.
